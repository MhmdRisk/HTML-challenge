## Fixes/Improvements:

- Turned ```<buttons>``` into ```<a>``` tags
- Fixed text under "Gallery" so that the paragraph falls under the heading
- Added horizontal lines where needed (gallery and footer)
- Fixed padding and margins for better spacing (namely also on the ```<aside>``` section so that it takes 75% of the page instead of 50%)
- Got rid of all modern borders
- Used colors accurate to the source image
