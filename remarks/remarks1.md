## Some minor remarks/findings while working on Level 1

- The colors I chose actually fail the contrast test for certain text sizes, however I decided to keep them considering I'm sticking to mostly the same font size throughout the webapp (so it shouldn't be an issue for now).
- Made the image (minimally) responsive
- Kept getting warnings that some tags are obsolete (strike, bold, h1, etc.)
