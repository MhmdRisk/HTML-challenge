## Some minor remarks/findings while working on Level 2

- ```<menu><li></li></menu>``` serves the same purpose as ```<ul></ul>``` (Do not use UL tag inside MENU tag)
- This one took much longer than expected as I had an issue where my divs were stacking on top of each other (img was covering unordered list of 5 items) instead of them appearing from top to bottom.
